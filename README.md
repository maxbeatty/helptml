I lead an HTML & CSS workshop to allow more people to try their ideas in the medium for which we design our products.

The notes from each session are in the [wiki](wiki) and examples are in their corresponding directories.

You need nothing more than a laptop, a text editor, and a browser for this workshop. Windows + Notepad + Internet Explorer is just as good as Mac + TextEdit + Safari for what I plan to cover.
