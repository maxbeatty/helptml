I lead an HTML & CSS workshop to allow more people to try their ideas in the medium for which we design our products.

These are the notes and examples from those workshops.

You need nothing more than a laptop, a text editor, and a browser for this workshop. Windows + Notepad + Internet Explorer is just as good as Mac + TextEdit + Safari for what I plan to cover.
