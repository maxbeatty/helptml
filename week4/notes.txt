    Comments
      Start with '/*' and end with '*/'

    Basic Statement

      selector {
        property: value;
      }

    Selector
      Read from right to left. Can use HTML elements, classes, IDs, and any combination there of as selectors.

    Property
      What you want to change about your element. Common properties are color, border, height, width, and so on.

    Value
      Depending on the property, may be a color value, pixel value, or keyword value

        color: blue;
        background-color: #fff;
        font-size: 14px;

    Combining Selectors
      You can combine selectors to be more specific about your styles.

      p {
        color: black;
      }

      footer p {
        color: white;
      }

      The paragraphs in the footer (remember to read from right to left)

    Classes
      When you want to apply the same style multiple times but not every time for an element, use a class. First, add a class to your markup.

      <button class="primary">Submit</button>
      <a class="primary" href="#submit>Submit</a>

      The selector for a class starts with a period.

      .primary {
        color: green;
      }

      Now all of the links and buttons will have a color green.
